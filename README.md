## REFLECTION PAPER

### DASHBOARD ALIGNMENT

The data dictionary details that hospitals are penalized for excessive readmissions. As an analyst, it is my job to deliver a solution that helps the executive leaders at these institutions be able to reduce readmission rates which in turn reduces or even eliminates their penalties from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). 

With that in mind, I created several visualizations that all display different metrics for patient readmissions. I chose to display the top 10 states across the United States of all patient readmissions. Next, I displayed gender, then age. I also displayed how the patient was initially admitted to the hospital. Lastly, I looked at patient medical conditions, and displayed these as well. All these visualizations are set to only show if the patient was readmitted, therefore, the executive leaders can use this to understand more about the patients that are being readmitted and can set their sights on these in the future to lower readmission rates. 

### ADDITIONAL DATA SET INSIGHTS

To complement my dataset, I decided to use data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) which is conducted by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) every two years. From the original dataset, I noticed that overweight patients represented the highest percentage of readmissions of current medical conditions. So, I pulled Body Mass Index (BMI) data from this report to show national weight categories. Nationally, nearly 50% of patients surveyed are overweight, which supports the original dataset. 

I also was able to visualize gender and age from this national dataset. This complements the original data by allowing the executive leaders to compare their stats to national numbers. With all of this in mind, the executive leaders will be able to use the visualizations on my dashboard to support their decision-making process for reducing readmissions. 

### DECISION-MAKING SUPPORT

Specifically, the United States map visualization highlights the top 10 offending states in readmissions. This enables these leaders to zero in on the hospitals in those states to reduce their overall rates. Afterall, this is where the largest impact can be made. Another interesting graph that gives useful information is the way in which the patient was initially admitted to the hospital. Over half of all readmissions come from patients who were initially admitted by way of the Emergency Room. This fact enables the executive leaders to look at ways in which they can improve the care that patients receive in the ER to reduce their readmission rates. 

### INTERACTIVE CONTROLS

I added two interactive controls on the dashboard that allows users to key in on several important variables in the dataset. The first control allows the user to select any age group represented in the graph. Upon selection, the entire dashboard and all the charts therein will update based on the choice that was selected. I also allowed for multiple choices to be selected at once. The second control allows the user to view how the patient was initially admitted to the hospital. Likewise, the user is also able to select multiple options. 

### DATA REPRESENTATIONS

I wanted to tell the story of what type of patients are being readmitted to hospitals. The gender pie chart visualization displays the breakdown between male and female genders that were readmitted to the hospital. I also used an age group bar chart to display how many patients with respect to their age were readmitted to the hospital. 

### AUDIENCE ANALYSIS

Knowing that my audience are my peers allowed me to get more technical in my approach to giving my results. Since they too are data analysts, I can present the data to them in a way that they can understand. This is useful to both them and me for their analysis of my results as well. It will enable them to supply valuable feedback to me that I can take to the stakeholders of this project. 

### UNIVERSAL ACCESS

To be more universally accessed, I decided to update several wordings on the graph to better portray the data. For example, rather than displaying the axis on a bar chart as “Count of Age Group”, I changed this to be “Number of Patients” instead. This is easier to understand to an average person reading this graph and easily identifies the graphs in more meaningful ways. 

### EFFECTIVE STORYTELLING

One of the main principles in effective storytelling is to know your audience. My audience is concerned about patient readmission rates as this greatly affects not only the patient’s health and wealth, but also negatively affects the hospital organization’s reputation and their revenue since fines occur when the readmission rates are too high. For this reason, each visualization in the WGU dashboard keys in on patient readmission data using several key indicators, such as age, gender, demographics, and the patient’s existing medical conditions. 

Another good element to effective storytelling is to be concise. This dataset has 10,000 observations, and as such, there are many stories that you could tell with this data. Too many graphs, and too many dashboards could overwhelm the audience, and this might turn them away from the message I am trying to portray. I decided to use just a few key indicators from this dataset to not confuse the audience. I also filtered down to only the top 10 states which makes these results more actionable to stakeholders.
